# Overview

A to move left. D to move right. Spacebar to jump. S to fall through blue platforms.

My reason for developing this was to reintroduce myself to the Unity landscape and become acquainted with it
for future projects.

# Development Environment

I used the Unity2D development suite to make this game.

# Useful Websites

* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) Found several instances of specific error codes I ran into and how to fix them.
* [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSR2vNOypvs5_wVgPrVmhCYOfAE__MKcs) Found this tutorial on how to get the very basics of this project started.
* [Unity Discussion Board](https://discussions.unity.com) When Stack Overflow didn't have the answer, I would find it here.

# Future Work

* Add a second level
* Add sound effects
* Improve pixel art
